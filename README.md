# PhonebookApp

Phonebook App

The following project was built independently while working through the FullStackOpen [https://fullstackopen.com/en/] curriculum.

Tech Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

This is meant to simulate a phonebook. Currently it is hooked up to a MongoDB database that I have set up at the following site: https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database. There is currently a profanity filter in place using the "obscenity" npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity.
It's not perfect but it appears to be better than the others I tested out.
You are able to Create a contact, refresh the page to Read from the database, Update existing contacts, and Delete contacts as well.

It can be found online here: https://phonebook-test-k2jo.onrender.com/
