Phonebook App

The following project was built independently while working through the FullStackOpen [https://fullstackopen.com/en/] curriculum. 

Tech Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

This is meant to simulate a phonebook. Currently it is hooked up to a MongoDB database https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database. There are not currently any filters being used for moderation.
I may add these later if the public access to this project online proves to be a bad move, or I may just take it down. 
You are able to Create a contact, refresh the page to Read from the database, Update existing contacts, and Delete contacts as well. 

It can be found online here: https://phonebook-test-k2jo.onrender.com/
